                <p>The programmer has taken a video of a portion of a piano recital he gave in New York City.
                    The video is hosted on AWS and is played on an instance of JWPlayer. According to the viewers
                    perferences, the video can be viewed by itself or with the music shown.</p>
                <p>If the viewer wishes to view the music as the video plays, checkboxes allow the viewer to
                    choose the extent to which the music played on the video is shown. The music can be followed
                    in brief slides and with an overlay highlighting the portion of the slide being played can be shown.
                    The speed with which the overlay traverses the slides is determined by the duration of the music
                    which
                    was determined to the 6th decimal point by a custom function used to capture each slide's duration
                    with respect to the music being played. The pages of the larger music score change according to
                    the video. A measure counter for the music being displayed is also available by checkbox.</p>
